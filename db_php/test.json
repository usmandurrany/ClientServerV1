On the roads the battle between buses, trams and cars is won by the piercing drone of continuous car horns.For banker Kenny Chen, 35, the last 15 months have been a nightmare as the area around his apartment block in the upmarket central Mid-Levels neighbourhood has surrendered to juddering construction sites.Hong Kong may boast some of the worlds most expensive apartments, but rapid growth in the past 30 years means residents live cheek by jowl even on the outskirts of the city beside busy main roads. While air pollution continues to be a major concern in the city, noise is also affecting lifestyles.Traffic, renovations, neighbours, construction and demolition were the worst bugbears, with sleep disturbance and general annoyance the biggest health effects.The government has brought in measures including resurfacing roads, restricting hours for construction work, promoting the use of quieter machinery and creating better-insulated homes, but many residents still suffer.In 2011 the government included the effects of noise for the first time in its regular Thematic Household Survey Report, which showed that 36 percent of people had suffered noise disturbance at home. Seven percent said they were disturbed a lot or nearly all the time.The effects on mental health can be detrimental, says Assistant Professor Arthur Mak of the department of psychiatry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Patients who live in public housing have even gone as far as asking him for a medical recommendation for them to move elsewhere. Relocation can take up to two years.Hong Kong police received more than 45,000 noise complaints in 2012, while the Environmental Protection Department receives around 5,000 noise complaints a year.The EPD figure has decreased slightly over the past decade, a reduction it attributes to the steps it has taken.It admits, though, that more than a million residents are exposed at home to traffic noise over the governments 70-decibel guideline, also the World Health Organizations recommended limit.Alternatives to noisy machinery like percussive pile drivers -- which lay foundations for new buildings, are also difficult to find, says the EPDs Principal Environmental Protection Officer Maurice Yeung.We are finding sites to construct residential buildings because we are facing a shortage of flats. We understand that people will find it noisy and we try to control it with the restricted hours, Yeung told AFP, although some residents complain that works are done outside those hours, which is possible with a special permit.Yeung added that the government was dealing with problems inherited by the rapid expansion of Hong Kong in the last three decades, the population has gone from 5.7 million in 1990 to over 7 million today.Public policy think tank Civic Exchange, which recently submitted a critique of noise policy to lawmakers, says the authorities could do more." }, { "title": "First Apple computer sells at auction for $387,750", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/Technology\/182661-First-Apple-computer-sells-at-auction-for-387750", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) - Known as the Apple 1, it was one of the first Apple computers ever built.It sold on Monday for $387,750 at a Christies online-only auction.

But Lebanese U.N. Ambassador Nawaf Salam told reporters that many more have come into Lebanon without registering and are staying with friends and families in informal asylum. He put the current total at a million-plus.Another estimated 500,000 Palestinian refugees are already in Lebanon.Still, Salam vowed that Lebanon will not close it borders. It will not turn back any refugees.Lebanon is a country of just 4 million people, so the huge numbers of refugees are politically sensitive in a nation that endured its own civil war in the 1980s.In Wednesdays statement, the Council also expressed its growing concern at the marked increase of cross-border fire from the Syrian Arab Republic into Lebanon, which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, as well as incursions, abductions, and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border.With Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, openly allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad and helping his troops fight the Syrian rebels, the Security Council called on all Lebanese parties to recommit to Lebanons policy of disassociation and to step back from any involvement in the Syrian crisis.The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says it anticipates that by the end of the year Lebanon will have to care for a million Syrians, 80,000 more Palestinian Syrian refugees, and 49,000 Lebanese returnees.The UNHCR said some 1.2 million Lebanese are affected by the refugee crisis, since Syrian refugees are now living in over 1,400 communities throughout Lebanon.The UN estimates that a total of 1.7 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon.The Security Council is expected to hold a meeting later this month to draw attention to the strain on Lebanons resources due to the Syrian war." }, { "title": "FIFA clears Iraq of age cheating at U20 World Cup", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/Sports\/182652-FIFA-clears-Iraq-of-age-cheating-at-U20-World-Cup-", "description": "ISTANBUL (AP) - FIFA has cleared Iraq of age cheating at the Under-20 World Cup following anonymous claims on Wednesday, hours before Iraq was scheduled to play Uruguay in the semifinals.FIFA says it received emails from unidentified persons by which allegations were made that players of team Iraq would not comply with the age limit.FIFA says it found no irregularities and was not further investigating the matter after verifying its data with the Asian Football Confederation, which provided the requested information regarding the players in question as well as the pertinent supporting documents.Only players born on or after Jan. 1, 1993, are eligible to participate in the U20 World Cup.In the other semifinal match, France will play Ghana." }, { "title": "China must stop cyber-theft: US", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/World\/182650-China-must-stop-cybertheft-US-", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Joe Biden says Chinas rise is good for the U.S. and the world but Chinese theft of U.S intellectual property must stop.Biden was speaking Wednesday at the opening of the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two world powers.Biden was introduced by Secretary of State John Kerry who has returned to Washington for the two-day dialogue from his wifes bedside in Boston after she was hospitalized.Cabinet-level officials will review security and economic issues that reflect growing ties but also deep-seated differences between the two countries.Biden said an open Internet is in both nations interests and outright cyber-enabling theft that U.S. companies are experiencing now must be viewed as out of bounds and needs to stop." }, { "title": "Koreas end talks on factories with no result", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/Business\/182649--Koreas-end-talks-on-factories-with-no-result-", "description": "SEOUL (AP) - Talks between the rival Koreas aimed at restarting a stalled inter-Korean factory park ended Wednesday with no breakthrough, but both sides agreed to meet again next week to discuss restoring what was once a rare symbol of cooperation between the archrivals.They also agreed to a separate set of talks next week on allowing reunions of families that have been separated for decades by the border between North and South Korea, Seouls Unification Ministry said in a statement.The ministry said Seoul rejected a proposal from North Korea to discuss resumption of South Korean tours to a North Korean mountain.The Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea, located just over the heavily armed border dividing the two countries, closed in April following North Koreas angry reaction to South Koreas annual military exercises with the United States and alleged insults against the Norths top leadership.North Korea has in recent weeks ratcheted down its warlike threats and pursued diplomacy with both Seoul and Washington, though it has not pulled back on its nuclear weapons development as the U.S., South Korea and other nations demand.The two Koreas recently agreed on a desire to reopen the complex, but they are still discussing how to do that.During Wednesdays talks at Kaesong, the rivals again shared the view that the factory complex should be maintained and developed, chief Seoul delegate Suh Ho told South Korean reporters after the meeting, according to media pool reports.He said the two sides agreed to meet in Kaesong again on Monday.The Unification Ministry said North Korea proposed additional working-level talks next week on reunions and the resumption of tours to the Diamond Mountain resort via an inter-Korean communication channel at the border village of Panmunjom.The ministry said Seoul accepted the offer on reunions because of the urgency of that issue, but rejected the offer on mountain tours because it wants to keep the focus on the factory park. It said the Kaesong complexs restart will be a touchstone for South-North Korean exchange and cooperation.Pyongyang wants the talks on separated families to be held at the mountain or Kaesong, but Seoul made a counterproposal to hold them in the border village of Panmunjom, the ministry said.Also on Wednesday, South Korean representatives of factories that operated at Kaesong visited the complex and inspected equipment that theyre worried could be ruined during the rainy season currently pounding the Korean Peninsula.Kim Hak-kwon, a member of a committee pushing for Kaesongs restoration, said humidity had damaged a lot of equipment. More than 10 South Korean workers should spend three to four weeks in Kaesong repairing and maintaining machines, Kim said.The complex combined South Korean know-how and capital with cheap North Korean labor, and was the centerpiece of cross-border cooperation projects hatched during a previous era of warming ties. Other joint projects between the two Koreas closed as relations soured over the past five years.North Korea in April pulled its 53,000 workers out of the industrial park, and South Korea then ordered its managers to leave as well, against their wishes.The park resulted in nearly $2 billion a year in cross-border trade before its shutdown.The closure meant a loss of salary for tens of thousands of North Korean workers employed in factories run by 123 South Korean companies, and a loss of goods and orders for business managers who relied on Kaesong to churn out everything from shoes and watches to cables and electrical components.The Korean Peninsula officially remains at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty." }, { "title": "Lazio, Genoa, Lecce face match-fixing trial", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/Sports\/182648--Lazio-Genoa-Lecce-face-matchfixing-trial-", "description": "ROME (AP) - Lazio, Genoa, Lecce and eight players, including Lazio captain Stefan Mauri, will face charges related to match-fixing, the Italian football federation said Wednesday.The federation said the charges include rigging games and failing to report match-fixing for two Serie A games Lazio vs. Genoa and Lecce vs. Lazio in May 2011.Mauri faces a charge of sporting fraud, as do Mario Cassano, Carlo Gervasoni, Omar Milanetto, Alessandro Zamperini, Massimiliano Benassi, Antonio Rosati and Stefano Ferrario.Mauri and Zamperini have also been cited for violating two articles of the Code of Sports Justice.That is concerned with the principles of loyalty, fairness and integrity, and prohibition of betting.If the charges are proved, the players face bans while the clubs could be deducted points.Last week, Serie B club Bari plea-bargained for a one-point penalty for match-fixing.Bari was also fined 25,000 euros ($32,000) under the deal made with the Italian Football Federations disciplinary committee for arranging two matches, while several former players also reached plea bargains.At least 50 people have been arrested in Italy for match-fixing since mid-2011, with matches under investigation by prosecutors in Cremona, Bari and Napoli.This marks the third consecutive offseason that point penalties have been handed out by the football federation.

More safety improvements will have to be made for other Philippine carriers, like budget airline Cebu Pacific Air, to follow, he said.Philippine Airlines, which has recently acquired new long-haul Airbus aircraft, plans to resume flights to London, Paris, Rome and Amsterdam as early as September, company president Ramon Ang said at a news conference.He commended President Benigno Aquino IIIs government for dealing with significant safety issues that have hounded the countrys aviation industry for years.Cebu Pacific, the countrys largest low-cost carrier, has complied with regulations and taken steps to deal with safety issues, but a recent accident involving one of its aircraft in southern Davao city revealed some weaknesses that still need to be addressed, Ledoux said.The plane veered off the runway, and although no one was hurt, the aircraft was stuck on the runway for two days, and passengers complained that it took about 15 minutes for emergency slides to be deployed.Philippine officials welcomed the EU decision. Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said it will boost tourism, enhance competitiveness and facilitate the entry of investments from the eurozone.Manila also expects the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to lift safety-linked restrictions later this year. Those restrictions have prohibited Philippine Airlines from expanding its flight operations in the United States and prevented other Manila-based carriers from opening air services to the U.S. mainland.The European Commission banned all Philippine carriers from entering its airspace in March 2010 due to noncompliance with international safety standards.The 2010 ban came after the International Civil Aviation Organization questioned whether Filipino aviation regulators could adequately ensure the safety of Philippine-registered airlines, and after the FAA downgraded the Philippines safety rating. ICAO is the Montreal-based U.N. aviation safety agency.John Andrews, deputy director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, said problems in his agency that had drawn concern, such as the lack of a database on all registered Philippine aircraft, have been corrected.Ledoux, the EU ambassador, said Philippine authorities also are addressing corruption. He mentioned a Manila news report about a former Philippine aviation official who was indicted for providing licenses to student pilots who had failed aviation proficiency tests.Clearly this is an issue that needed to be addressed and has been addressed, Ledoux said." }, { "title": "China discovers primitive, 5,000-year-old writing", "link": "http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/index.php\/en\/Technology\/182646-China-discovers-primitive-5000yearold-writing-", "description": "BEIJING (AP) - Archaeologists say they have discovered a new form of primitive writing in markings on stoneware excavated from a relic site in eastern China dating about 5,000 years back.The inscriptions are about 1,400 years older than the oldest known written Chinese language and around the same age as the oldest writing in the world.Chinese scholars are divided on whether the etchings amount to actual writing or a precursor to words that should be described as symbols, but they say the finding will help shed light on the origins of Chinese language and culture.The oldest current known Chinese writing has been found on animal bones known as oracle bonesdating to 3,600 years ago during the Shang dynasty.The inscriptions have not been reviewed by experts outside of the country, but a group of Chinese scholars on archaeology and ancient writing met last weekend in Zhejiang province to discuss the finding.They agreed that the incisions found on more than 200 pieces dug out from the Neolithic-era Liangzhu relic site south of Shanghai are not enough to indicate any developed writing system.But lead archaeologist Xu Xinmin said they include evidence of words on two broken stone-ax pieces.One of the pieces has six word-like shapes strung together to resemble a short sentence.The pieces are among thousands of fragments of ceramic, stone, jade, wood, ivory and bone excavated from the Liangzhu relic site between 2003 and 2006, Xu said.They are different from the symbols we have seen in the past on artifacts, Xu said of the markings. The shapes and the fact that they are in a sentence-like pattern indicate they are expressions of some meaning.The six characters are arranged in a line, and three of them resemble the modern Chinese character for human beings. Each shape has two to five strokes.If five to six of them are strung together like a sentence, they are no longer symbols but words, said Cao Jinyan, a scholar on ancient writing at Hangzhou-based Zhejiang University. He said the markings should be considered hieroglyphics.He said there are also stand-alone shapes with more strokes. If you look at the composition, you will see they are more than symbols, Cao said.But archaeologist Liu Zhao from Shanghai-based Fudan University warned that there was not sufficient material for any conclusion.I dont think they should be considered writing by the strictest definition, Liu said. We do not have enough material to pin down the stage of those markings in the history of ancient writings.For now, the Chinese scholars have agreed to call them primitive writing, a vague term that suggests the Liangzhu markings are somewhere between symbols and words.The oldest writing in the world is believed to be from Mesopotamia, dating back more than 5,000 years.
